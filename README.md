This is a simple snake and ladder game using SDL2.

What I learned:
Main things I learned are better implementation of the idea of modularization,classes and working with the SDL2 library.

Current state and future fixes:
While functioning, this project is still considered incomplete. It is lacking both in comments and certain features,mainly a winning animation and the reset that should come after(or at least asking the user if he wants to continue), a starting animation,adding a single player mode,movmemnt animation and so on and so forth.
I can't say if i will be fixing everything but I added it here either way since if fullfils its purpose as a snake and ladder game at least.

Tutorial I used while making this project:
I mainly used this playlist:
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhfAbcv9cehhkG7ZQK0nfIGJC_C-wSLrx&si=eTicXy0SF8_iN1ri 
by Let's Make Games (@CarlBirch)
I didn't watch the whole playlist (only until the 9th video in the playlist) due to the simplicity of my project in comparasion to his.

Assets and ownership:
I own all the assets except for the japanese style tile floor behind the board which I took from ibisPaint X and the dirt png which I took from pixilart.com .
